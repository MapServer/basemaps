trying to define a topographic map based on opentopomap (https://github.com/der-stefan/OpenTopoMap)

• @ zoom < 9: relief raster + roads
• @zoom >= 9: vector objects + relief hiil + slope only ?
• @zoom >= 11: contour lines
     z= 11: 50m equi, 100m ?

TODO:
• licence
• imposm3 conf for all features
